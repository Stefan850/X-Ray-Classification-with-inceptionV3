# Getting Started
 - Install all dependencies
 - Download Files (see Link above)
 - Run file with Jupyter Notebook
 - Try new combinations of Layers (Dense, Dropout)
    
# Result
 - 62% of Test data correct classified
 - Train Accuracy significant higher than Val. Accuracy -> Indication for overfitting
